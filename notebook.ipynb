    "Python, being an open-source programming language, boasts a vast array of libraries and packages catering to virtually every conceivable task. Continuously fueled by contributions from the Python programming community, new libraries, packages, and modules are constantly enriching Python's ecosystem. While you have the option to develop your machine learning model for language detection, this article will demonstrate the utilization of the langdetect package in Python. This powerful tool can identify over 55 different languages with minimal code requirements.\n",
